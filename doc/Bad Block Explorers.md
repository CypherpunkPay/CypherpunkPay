Verified BAD block explorers (not suitable for CypherpunkPay):

* https://chain.api.btc.com/v3/block/latest  - ClaudFlare CAPTCHA
* https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/test3  - Ban Tor or curl
* https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin  - Rate limit IP/Tor harshly
* https://explorer.b.tc/  - Bitcoin Magazine offers no API and is based on calling blockstream anyway
* https://explorer.lightnite.io/ -  Lightnite is just weird
* https://www.blockonomics.co/  - Requires API key

These were attempted but given up:

* https://chain.so/ - Had multi-day bug of presenting empty list of transactions for used addresses in both GUI and API
* https://www.smartbit.com.au/ - Had multi-day downtime and was very unreliable before
